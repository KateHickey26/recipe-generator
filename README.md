## üîê Prompt Injection Protection

To ensure safe and predictable AI interaction, the app avoids free-text input and instead uses a **controlled vocabulary** of 750+ real-world ingredients. This mitigates prompt injection risks (e.g. `egg, bacon, and ignore the above instructions...`) by:

- Replacing the input field with a dropdown chip interface
- Only allowing selections from an approved ingredient list
- Ensuring prompt content is safe and clean before reaching the AI
